         Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn 
           and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
           Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that
           can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
         <br>
          <br>Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted 
          to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is,
           methods that leverage data to improve performance on some
            set of tasks.It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
            Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data,
             known as training data, in order to make predictions 
          or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p>
          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>The automotive industry is one of the areas where Machine 
         Learning is excelling by changing the definition of ‘safe’ driving. 
         There are a few major companies such as Google, Tesla, Mercedes Benz,
          Nissan, etc. that have invested hugely in Machine Learning to come up with novel innovations. 
          However, Tesla’s self-driving car is the best in the industry. These self-driving cars are built
           using Machine Learning, IoT sensors,
          high-definition cameras, voice recognition systems, etc.</p>

                  natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</p>
              <h3>Scope</h3>
                      <p>Along the years, in the field of AI, two major approaches developed namely the Human
                         Approach and the Ideal Approach. The human approach was based on creating systems that 
                         think and act like humans, whereas the Ideal Approach, was based on creating systems that 
                         have the capacity to think and act rationally. Scientists, all over the world, have seamlessly
                         worked in both approaches and many milestones have been achieved both ways. </p>

             <p>The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) has estimated that India alone will need about 1 million cybersecurity professionals by the end of 2020 to tackle cybercrime dangers. 
                            This has serious implications for the economy at large
                            You can start with an IT degree and diploma and enroll in any of the flagship cybersecurity
                             programs offered by some of India’s premier institutes.
